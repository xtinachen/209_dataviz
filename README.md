# W209 Assignment 1 template

A simple template to get you started on your first assignment. Includes very basic files for HTML [index.html](index.html) CSS [css/main.css](css/main.css) and ECMAScript/JavaScript [main.js](js/main.js). Uses d3.v4 and loads data from a csv file on the data folder [data/main.csv](data/main.csv).

The package.json file can be used with node.js for establishing the development requirements. Includes also a [.eslint.js](.eslint.js) file with a basic default linting configuration. For setting up Sublime with [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) check [this tutorial video of how to get everything set up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5bbPEAOwYs)

## How to use it

You need to use a local http server to test it.

If you have python 3

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

If you have python 2.7

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Then go to your browser and load the URL http://localhost:8080
